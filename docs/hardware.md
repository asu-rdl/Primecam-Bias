# Hardware Documentation

The Bias Boards were designed using KiCAD 9.0.2. The project [can be found on github](https://github.com/asu-rdl/Primecam-Bias/tree/main/board).

[Here is a link to the schematics in PDF form](./primecamLNABiasPotVreg.pdf)

And this is a screenshot of the layout as well as pdf links to the layout. Viewing the layout on KiCAD is the best choice.
