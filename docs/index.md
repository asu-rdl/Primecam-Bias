# Intro
The CCAT observatory's instrument "Prime-Cam" requires a power supply for a large array of low-noise amplifiers. 
They want to have easy to use, programmable control over the power supply (also referred to as 'bias supply').
We (ASU) aim to deliver on that need. These docs contain the Hardware and Software design as well as a userguide.
